# The PR fixer machine: an unprivileged account running the agent bridge

Task t18 (claims c30; honesty condition h24; deviation d8). This is the
operator recipe for the machine the PR fixer's agent runs on: **spark2**. One
cultureagent bridge, Qwen Code on cortex, runs as a systemd user unit of a
dedicated account, `culture-fixer`. The engine reaches it over the tailnet as
the agent actor `qwen-fixer`. Codex is not installed on spark2: it stays on
spark (d8).

**Steps marked *operator* are hand-turns.** They need root on spark2 or a
GitHub or SonarCloud login in a browser. Everything else runs as
`culture-fixer`, which never holds root.

## What the account may and may not touch

The agent runs tools as the bridge's Unix user. The bridge does not sandbox
the host (see cultureagent's `docs/bridges.md`, "Trust boundary"), so the
account is the boundary:

| The account can | The account cannot |
|---|---|
| fetch `https://github.com/agentculture/*` into its own caches and commit locally | push: the bridge refuses it and every cache's push URL is unusable; the GitHub App pushes after the engine's test gate |
| read PRs, checks and Actions logs with its own read-only GitHub token | read the engine node's `node.env`, grant store or the App private key (another user's mode-700 directories) |
| read SonarCloud issues with its own token, and call cortex with its own API key | use the operator's `gh`, `claude` or `codex` logins (they live in the operator's home, mode 750) |

Known limit: the bridge passes its environment on to the agent, and both run
as the same user. The agent can therefore read the bridge's own bearer token
and could call its own bridge. That reaches nothing the agent cannot already
do as that user, and it is tracked as plan risk r11.

## Where the secrets live

All of them are in **grant**, in `culture-fixer`'s own per-user store; none
is in a file, a config or a `gh` login. An administrator writes into that
store with `sudo grant set NAME - --hidden --user culture-fixer` (the value
from stdin). The unit injects them at exec time:

| grant name (in `culture-fixer`'s store) | Injected as | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `FIXER_QWEN_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | `QWEN_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` | the bridge: the bearer token it requires |
| `FIXER_CORTEX_API_KEY` | `QWEN_CUSTOM_API_KEY_CORTEX` | Qwen Code: the cortex endpoint's key |
| `FIXER_GITHUB_TOKEN` | `GH_TOKEN` | the agent: `gh` and the GitHub API, read-only |
| `FIXER_SONAR_TOKEN` | `SONAR_TOKEN` | the agent: SonarCloud reads |

The engine node on spark2 holds the same bridge token in **its** store as
`RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN`, referenced by the actor as
`grant:RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN`.

## 1. Create the account (operator, root)

Copy `deploy/pr-fixer/` to spark2 (or use a checkout there), then:

```bash
sudo bash create-user.sh --authorize-key spark.pub            # plan only
sudo bash create-user.sh --authorize-key spark.pub --apply
```

It creates `culture-fixer` with its own group and home (mode 750), no sudo
and no operator groups, enables lingering so its unit starts at boot, and
lets the one given SSH key log in as the account, so the installer can run
there without root. Leave `--authorize-key` out to do step 3 yourself with
`sudo -iu culture-fixer`.

## 2. Seal the secrets (operator)

On spark2, from the operator account. The bridge token is generated once in
the node's store and copied into the account's store, so the two match:

```bash
G=~/.local/bin/grant
$G generate RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN --hidden --bytes 32 --encoding hex
$G run --inject T=RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN -- sh -c 'printf %s "$T"' \
  | sudo $G set FIXER_QWEN_BRIDGE_TOKEN - --hidden --user culture-fixer
# -e: fail instead of sealing the word "null" when the key is absent
jq -er '.env.QWEN_CUSTOM_API_KEY_OPENAI_HTTP_LOCALHOST_8000' ~/.qwen/settings.json \
  | tr -d '\n' | sudo $G set FIXER_CORTEX_API_KEY - --hidden --user culture-fixer
```

Then create two read-only tokens in a browser and paste each one in. `grant set`
reads stdin without a prompt, so use `read -rsp`, which prompts, hides the input and
seals no trailing newline:

- GitHub: a fine-grained token, resource owner `agentculture`, all
  repositories, permissions **Contents: Read, Pull requests: Read, Actions:
  Read, Commit statuses: Read** (Metadata: Read is implied). Fine-grained
  tokens have no Checks permission (it exists only for GitHub Apps); the engine
  reads check runs through the App and hands the failing ones to the agent, and
  Actions: Read covers the job logs.
  `read -rsp "GitHub token: " T && printf %s "$T" | sudo $G set FIXER_GITHUB_TOKEN - --hidden --user culture-fixer; unset T`
- SonarCloud: **My Account → Security → Generate token** (a user token).
  `read -rsp "Sonar token: " T && printf %s "$T" | sudo $G set FIXER_SONAR_TOKEN - --hidden --user culture-fixer; unset T`

## 3. Install the tools and the bridge (as `culture-fixer`)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh          # uv, into ~/.local/bin
~/.local/bin/uv tool install grant
# Node.js and Qwen Code 0.24.7 (the bridge's handshake accepts only listed versions)
npm install --prefix ~/.local/lib/qwen-code @qwen-code/qwen-code@0.24.7
ln -sf ~/.local/lib/qwen-code/node_modules/.bin/qwen ~/.local/bin/qwen
# gh, from the release tarball, into ~/.local/bin (reads GH_TOKEN; no gh login)
bash install.sh --host "<spark2 tailnet IP>"                # plan only
bash install.sh --host "<spark2 tailnet IP>" --apply
```

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/cultureagent-bridges/venv` | `cultureagent==0.14.0` |
| `~/.config/cultureagent-bridges/qwen.json` (mode 600) | bind the tailnet IP on 8093; allowlist prefix `https://github.com/agentculture/`; one run at a time; `commit_author` the App bot |
| `~/.qwen/settings.json` (mode 600) | Qwen Code on cortex; the key comes from `QWEN_CUSTOM_API_KEY_CORTEX` |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/cultureagent-qwen-bridge.service` | `grant run --inject ... -- cultureagent-qwen-bridge --config ...` |

Every agent commit is authored as
`rules-culture-dev[bot] <337624453+rules-culture-dev[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>`,
the identity the App pushes as.

## 4. Give the node the bridge token and register the actor

On spark2, as the operator account, add the token to the engine node
(`deploy/node/install.sh --secret RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN`, alongside its other
`--secret` flags), then register the actor. `callback_url` is the API's LAN
base URL (the bridge posts to `POST /bridge-invocations/{id}/events`, which
checks the per-invocation token itself):

```json
{
  "id": "qwen-fixer",
  "name": "PR fixer (Qwen Code on cortex)",
  "kind": "agent",
  "machine": "spark2",
  "harness": "qwen",
  "model": "cortex",
  "params": {
    "bridge_url": "http://<spark2 tailnet IP>:8093",
    "callback_url": "http://<API LAN host>:<port>",
    "bridge_token": "grant:RULES_QWEN_FIXER_TOKEN",
    "model": "cortex",
    "mode": "yolo"
  }
}
```

The qwen bridge refuses a run without `mode`.

## 5. Let the node run the test gate as `culture-fixer` (operator, root; *planned*)

The fixer workflow's `gate` step (`kind: code`, `config.builtin: gate`,
`culture_rules/actors/gate.py`, task t13) runs on spark2's engine node. It
reads the `gate:` section of `culture.yaml` **from the PR's base commit**,
runs the diff guard, then runs the declared setup and test argv lists in a
fresh checkout of the agent's commit (never in the agent's worktree). It runs
nothing as the node user: every command that touches the worktree or the
checkout goes through the prefix in `CULTURE_RULES_GATE_RUN_AS`, and while
that is unset the step fails `gate_runner_unconfigured`.

Give the node user exactly one sudo grant, to run `env` as `culture-fixer`
without a password. Then set the prefix in the node's environment (its
`node.env`, then restart the node). `PATH` must reach the account's
`~/.local/bin`, because sudo resets the environment:

```bash
echo 'spark2 ALL=(culture-fixer) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/env' \
  | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/culture-rules-gate && sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/culture-rules-gate
# node.env:
CULTURE_RULES_GATE_RUN_AS=sudo -n -u culture-fixer -- /usr/bin/env PATH=/home/culture-fixer/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

The gate appends `env -C <dir> -- <argv>` to that prefix, so each command
runs in that directory as `culture-fixer`, as an argv list, with no shell
anywhere. A prefix that starts with `ssh`, `su` or a shell is refused:
those would join argv into a shell command line.

What the grant means:

- **The node user can run anything as `culture-fixer`.** That is the point of
  the grant. `culture-fixer` is the less privileged account, and the reverse
  direction does not exist.
- **The PR's code never runs as the node user**, and never sees the node's
  `node.env`, grant store or App key.
- **On a timeout the node can only signal `sudo`.** sudo passes `SIGTERM` on
  to the command. A process that ignores it keeps running as `culture-fixer`.

The gate never reads git data in the worktree, which belongs to
`culture-fixer`, so git there would trip `safe.directory` for the node. As
`culture-fixer`, it streams one pack of the base, start and agent commits out
of the worktree (`git pack-objects --revs --stdout`). The pack goes into a
fresh bare repository that the node owns, where git checks every object's
hash. The diff guard and the base `culture.yaml` are read there, with no
hooks, no attributes and no global config.

The tests run in a fresh checkout, not in the worktree, because the agent
controls the worktree's index and untracked files. A `--skip-worktree` edit
or a stray `conftest.py` there would otherwise change what is tested. Each
gate run works like this:

1. As `culture-fixer`, the gate makes a directory with `mktemp -d` in that
   account's own temp space (mode 700, owned by `culture-fixer`).
2. It runs `git init` there and feeds the node-verified pack to
   `git index-pack --stdin`. The node opens the pack file (mode 600, in the
   node's own mode-700 temp directory) and passes it as `culture-fixer`'s
   stdin, so that account never reads a path the node owns.
3. It checks out the commit, verifies that `HEAD` is the commit and that
   `git status --porcelain --ignored` is empty, runs the gate, and removes
   the directory, also on failure.

Every git call in that checkout ignores `culture-fixer`'s own git config,
which the agent can edit. It runs with `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`,
`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, an empty template and `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, so
no hook runs. `culture-fixer` never needs read access to the bundle either:
only `github.push`, running as the node user, reads it.

When the verdict is `pass`, the gate writes a bundle of the commit for
`github.push` into `CULTURE_RULES_GATE_BUNDLE_DIR` (default
`~/.local/state/culture-rules/gate-bundles`). Bundles older than seven days
are pruned. The bundle path exists only on spark2, so `github.push` must run
there too.

Before a fixer run, seed the shared variable `fixer_protected_paths`. Its
patterns are added to the built-in floor, `.github/workflows/**`. While the
variable is unset, every verdict is `guard` with rule `protected_paths_unset`:

```bash
culture-rules variables set fixer_protected_paths --apply --value \
  '[".github/workflows/**", "sonar-project.properties", ".coveragerc", "setup.cfg", ".flake8", "pyproject.toml"]'
```

## 6. Verify

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| as `culture-fixer`: `cat /home/spark2/.config/culture-rules/node.env`, `ls /home/spark2/.qwen`, `grant list` | permission denied twice; `grant list` shows only the four `FIXER_*` names |
| `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://<spark2 tailnet IP>:8093/v1/capabilities` | `401` |
| the same with `-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` | `200` and the capability document (`"pushes": false`) |
| as `culture-fixer`, through grant: `gh api repos/agentculture/culture-rules/pulls` | `200`; a `gh pr merge` or a push is refused |
| `culture-rules actors list` | `qwen-fixer`, machine `spark2` |

## On spark2

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Account | `culture-fixer` (planned; created by the operator) |
| Bridge | qwen on 8093, tailnet only |
| Actor | `qwen-fixer` (planned) |

## Which repos carry a gate section (t19)

A repo without `gate:` gets comments only; the fixer never pushes there.
Survey of the non-fork, non-archived agentculture repos, 2026-10-07.

| Repo | Gate |
|---|---|
| `culture-agent-template` | main (0.10.0, #34) |
| `devague` | main (0.24.2, #122) |
| `steward` | main (0.28.1, #85) |
| `guildmaster` | PR #137 (0.26.14) |
| `culture-rules` | this repo's final PR (rules/pr-fixer) |

Not yet, standard pattern (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest -n auto`); later batches,
each with the operator's go-ahead:

`agentsgit`, `agtag`, `appsec`, `associate`, `callsmith`, `climate-cli`, `code-lens-cli`, `culture`, `culture-nodes`, `culture-tools`, `data-refinery-cli`, `devex`, `dgx-spark-cli`, `discord-bot-cli`, `dominion-breaker`, `drone-cli`, `ebooks-cli`, `ec2-cli`, `ec2bedrock-cli`, `edge-ai-lab`, `eidetic-cli`, `embeddings-cli`, `embeddings-lens`, `events-cli`, `evidence-cli`, `face-cli`, `face-recognition-cli`, `fleet-cli`, `headspace-cli`, `innereye`, `intern-cli`, `jetson`, `jetson-ai-lab-cli`, `jetson-arena`, `jetson-cli`, `jetson-containers-agent`, `jetson-orin-cli`, `jetson-thor-cli`, `jetsonrun`, `jev-factory`, `katvan`, `knowledgebase-cli`, `league-of-agents`, `learn-cli`, `lecodeur`, `lobes-cli`, `media-cli`, `microphone-cli`, `neurosymbolic-system`, `notion-agent`, `nvsh`, `operator-cli`, `org`, `protocols-cli`, `prove-cli`, `reachy-lobes`, `reduce-cli`, `refactoring-cli`, `reterminal-cli`, `rigor-cli`, `rollout-cli`, `rtx-spark-cli`, `sensibo-cli`, `shabbos-goy`, `shell-cli`, `spanish-cli`, `storybook-cli`, `substack-cli`, `tensor-cli`, `unsloth-cli`, `webcam-cli`, `workledger-cli`, `xitter`, `xteink`.

Not yet, need their own gate (extra install flags, or browser or slow test passes in
CI):

`auntiepypi`, `colleague`, `embodiment`, `league-of-agents-platform`, `microduck-cli`, `reachy-mini-cli`, `telegram-agent`, `webglass-cli`.

No gate by design, no `culture.yaml`: `cultureflare`, `gitculture-cli`, `grant`, `nebula-run`, `office-agent`, `ship-game-v1`, `tipalti`. Not a uv project: `reachy-mini-mcp`.
`cultureagent` has no `culture.yaml` and was swapped out of batch 1 for
`guildmaster` (operator, 2026-10-07).
